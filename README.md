IoT devices have been around for quite a while now. They are used to collect data through different kinds of sensors such as Motion sensors: These use a visual sensor to detect a change in apparent temperature of surroundings or when someone comes in the field of view of a camera. Heat sensors: These are used in trucks which carry perishable goods like fish and milk where changes in a temperature lower the shelf life of the produce. These are also used to detect forest fires.

Vibration sensors: These are used in car crash tests and detecting if someone is trying to cut a tree.

A lot of people are using smartwatches and fitness watches to track their daily physical activities, calories burnt, average resting heart rates, sleep cycle so that they lead a fit life. Such wearables are equipped with laser sensors to collect data.

Heat Index (temperature + humidity ) is one common data recorded on these IoT readers. The frequency of the upcoming data is very fast. The sensor reads hundreds to millions of data per second. There is a huge and versatile application of this data in real-world like agriculture, weather forecasting, soil monitoring and treatment, enterprise maintenance etc.
